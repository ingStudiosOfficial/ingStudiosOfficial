# About
Hi, I'm Ethan and I started (ing) Studios. I make [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@ai-turtle) videos. I also programme so as a result I never touch grass. My favourite language is **JavaScript** cuz it makes sense and everything, like look at those **BEAUTIFUL** curly **{brackets}**, and also cuz its not **indentation based**. I don't like **Lua**, cuz it's 1 based indexing. Python's mid. Oh yeah, I do **Java** and **Kotlin** too. But **PLEASE** why is Java statically typed! That's such a pain.

# What I develop
I mainly develop **Chrome Extensions** and websites.

## What I'm working on
I'm working on an Extension called [**InfiniteCopy**](https://github.com/ing-Studios-Web-Labs/infinitecopy). I'm also working on a site called **SchoolWorky**, but that's currently *TOP SECRET*!

## What I've completed
I've completed **WeatherGo**, whcih is a terrible product and you should not use it.

# Thanks for all your support :p
