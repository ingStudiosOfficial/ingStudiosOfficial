# HEYYY It's me Ethan...
Hi, I'm Ethan and I started (ing) Studios. I make [**YouTube**](https://youtube.com/@ai-turtle) videos. I also programme stuff so as a result I never touch grass. Just a web developer? Maybe? I also make CLIs such as my [**Terminal Task Manager**](https://github.com/ingStudiosOfficial/terminaltaskmanager). I also do some Python stuff, Jupyter notebooks. I also developed some Chrome Extensions such as [**InfiniteCopy**](https://github.com/ing-Studios-Web-Labs/infinitecopy) and [**LauncherTab**](https://github.com/ing-Studios-Web-Labs/launchertab). All my web projects (my favourite stuff to do) can be found [**here**](https://github.com/ing-Studios-Web-Labs). Thanks for reading, open to dev requests and happy to contribute, just email me at [**ingstudiosofficial@gmail.com**](mailto:ingstudiosofficial@gmail.com?subject=Developer%20Request).
